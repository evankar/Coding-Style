# Coding Style


   - Unix-style line endings
   - K&R-style indentation
   - No space before newlines
   - A blank line at the end of each file
   - Never more than one blank line in a row
   - Always tabs, never spaces
   - No more than 79-columns per line
   - One tab per indent
   - A space between control keywords and their corresponding paren
     `if (x)`, `while (x)`, and `switch (x)`, never `if(x)`, `while(x)`, or
     `switch(x)`
   - A space after most of the keyword and around operators
   - A space between anything and an open brace
   - No space between a function name and an opening paren. `puts(x)`, not
     `puts (x)`
   - Function declarations at the start of the line
   - Split long conditional expressions into small `static inline`
   - To comment out some code, use #if 0 (...) #endif
